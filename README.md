# Soft-sensor-for-estimating-CO2-for-a-carbon-capture-pilot-plant
A hybirid mechanistic and data-driven (Denoise Autoencoder (DAE) - Long-short term Memory (LSTM)) model for estimating the CO2 concentration profile for the CO2 absorber of the carbon capture plant. The tested dimensionality reduction techniques include: DAE, principal component analysis (PCA) / propoer orthogonal decomposition (POD). The absorber has 6 sampling points while there is only one gas analyzer, this work aims to build a soft sensor to use the other continuous process record to infer the CO2 concentration at these points. The DAE-LSTM approach is then compared to a semisupervised estimation method. The paper related to this work was submitted to Computers in Industry and it is currently in revision.
